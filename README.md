## Common Edits

### Add a lab member

Edit `_data/people.yml`. Add an entry to the appropriate section
(`pi`, `grad_students`, `postdocs`, `undergrads`). Place a square photo in
`assets/images/people/` and reference it in the `photo:` field.

### Add a research project

Create `_research/project-slug.md` using the existing example as a template.

### Add a publication output (non-ORCID)

Add an entry to `_data/outputs.yml`. These appear in the "Lab Outputs" section
of the Publications page.

### Add a poster (student PR workflow)

1. Add poster PDF + optional preview image to `assets/showcase/`:
   ```
   assets/showcase/your-name-conference-year.pdf
   assets/showcase/your-name-conference-year-preview.jpg
   ```
2. Create `_showcase/your-name-conference-year.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Poster Title"
   author: "Your Name"
   event: "Conference Name 2025"
   year: 2025
   pdf: /assets/showcase/your-name-conference-year.pdf
   image: /assets/showcase/your-name-conference-year-preview.jpg
   ---
   Brief description of the poster.
   ```
3. Open a Pull Request — a maintainer will review and merge.

## Publications — ORCID Sync

Publications are automatically synced from ORCID `0000-0002-8219-8983` via a
GitHub Action that runs every Sunday.

**Manually trigger a sync:**

1. Go to **Actions → Sync ORCID Publications → Run workflow**

**Sync script:** `scripts/sync_orcid.py`  
**Output:** `_data/publications.json` (committed automatically by the Action)
